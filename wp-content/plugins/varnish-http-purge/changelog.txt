= 3.9.3 =
* Update Documentation and Readme

= 3.9.2 =
* Change purge notice so it can be dismissed.
* Fix purging of deleted posts.

= 3.9.1 =
* Fixing i18n which wasn't working and threw a stupid error on sites without pretty permalinks. (Props DH customer Rasmus and employee Heckman!)

= 3.9 =
* Retain query params on purge
* Do not use query part for regex purging [Credit: shaula](https://github.com/Ipstenu/varnish-http-purge/pull/18)
* Allow Varnish IP to be filtered. [Credit: floatingio](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/supply-varnish-ip-via-filter)
* Improve flushing for cases when there's no Post ID
* Add filter so other plugins can add events to trigger purge when they have no post ID
* Add compatibility with [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/) so it flushes Varnish when you flush their cache

= 3.8 =
* Add varnish_http_purge_events filter to allow people to add their own events for purging. (props @norcross)
* Add a method to grab the response from purge request and pass to the 'after_purge_url' action for debugging. (props @shaula)
* Added wp-cli command: wp varnish purge (to purge varnish)
* Adding some docblocks
* Fixing i18n

= 3.7.3 =
* Add varnish_http_purge_schema filter for changing the default schema. The default remains http (even if you set your home and/or site URL to https) because of sanity, but in order to support some edge cases, they can filter if they want. (props Drumba)

= 3.7.2 =
* Revisions were being mishandled and purging all inappropriately. (props Cha0sgr)

= 3.7.1 =
* Archives weren't purging. (props Ingraye)

= 3.7 =
* Optimizing flushes.
* Add filter to allow other people to hook in when 3rd party plugins are abjectly weird (props jnachtigall)

= 3.6 =
* Making purge be http only, since Varnish doesn't support https. This will prevent other issues for people using SSL with Varnish (though goodness knows why...)
* Forcing backslash on home_url. Why WP doesn't, I have no idea, but this will help sites not running regex.

= 3.5.1 =
* Language fix
* Using add_query_arg
* Ignore revisions

= 3.5 =
* Isset wrap for URL path and query which may not be set in rare conditions (props <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/undefined-index-notices-4">hsz</a>)
* Added in flushing for feeds (requested by <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/feed-not-purged">heypete</a>)

= 3.4 =
* Multisite support
* Button in toolbar
* Fix define message in debug mode
* Better parsing for if you set the define in the DB or config.

= 3.3.4 =
* Rollback. Sorry.

= 3.3.3 =
* Per request of Jetpack team, added in a <code>wp_cache_flush()</code> call when manually purging. This should only impact server side PHP caches (APC, Memcached etc)

= 3.3.2 =
* Varnish IP was too persnickity in PHP 5.4 (added in an 'and if not null' check - props <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/patch-a-little-patch-to-purge-on-comment-posting">colinleroy</a>)

= 3.3.1 =
* Language Pack fixing.

= 3.3 =
* Quick and dirty fix for a plugin that is causing the URLs to purge <em>ALL THE TIME</em>

= 3.2 =
* Correcting conflict with host's default config.

= 3.1 =
* Refactoring Cleanup (otherwise known as Copy/Pasta error in variable name). (props Shredder)

= 3.0 =
* Adds 'Purge Varnish' button
* More selective purging, to account for different server setups
* Tighened up what purges and when
* Flushing categories and tags (per code from WP Super Cache, thanks!)
* Clarify requirements (Varnish and Pretty Permalinks)

= 2.3 =
* Purge images on deletion
* Fix for a VarnishIP when behind proxy servers not working on all hosts (props Berler)

= 2.2.1 =
* typo (hit . instead of / - Props John B. Manos)

= 2.2 =
* Added in workaround for Varnish purge reqs going AWOL when another proxy server is in place. (props to Shredder and Berler)
* Cache flushes when you change themes

= 2.1 =
* Header Image

= 2.0 =
* Commit access handed to Ipstenu
* Changed CURL to wp_remote_request (thank you <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/incompatability-with-editorial-calendar-plugin?replies=1">Kenn Wilson</a>) so we don't have to do <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-varnish-http-purge-incompatibility-with-woocommerce?replies=6">CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER</a> Remember kids, CURL is okay, but wp_remote_request is more better.

= 1.2.0 =
* Moved actual request execution to "shutdown" event
* Removed GET request due to bad performance impact
